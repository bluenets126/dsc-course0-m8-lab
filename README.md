Assumption
Note that we are only working off of accidnet/incident data.  This does not account for the amount of total flights that a particular Make/Model have in a given year which can provide more detail into the actual sustainability into the plane.  But based off the crash data given, below are the thoughts and recommendations.


Only included airplanes where amatuer build = No

Total passengers = serious + Fatal + Minor + Uninjured

If total passengers is 0 remove row

For desturction ratio.  Didn't include unknowns in data calculation.  So only Yes and No values calculated



### Discussion

-Large planes seem to have a higher destruction rate than smaller planes.

-Planes overall seem to have a pretty similar serious/fatal injury rate, however large planes have a higher potential for more catastrophic injuries

-There is a trend for both large and small planes where the rate of destruction goes up, the potential for higher risk of serious/fatal injury also goes up



DISCUSSION

-Large planes really come down to a few Makes.  Boeing and Airbus are the two main Large Plane producers and therefor cover the majority of data.  Of those, Boeing has the lower serious injury rate for all Models compared to Airbus.

-Small planes have many more makes associated with them.  Many more accidents to get data from too. That being said, Piper seems to be one of the Makes that have the highest serious/fatal injury rate for their plane types.  Cessna and Boeing seem to have the best make for low risk of injury




### Recommendation
Large Plane based on the data given seems to be the plane company Bombardier which has the smallest Destruction rate and lowest Serious/Fatal Injury Rate
1)Bombardier
2)Boeing
3)Airbus

Small Planes have three good choices.  The Injury rate and destruction rate are all comporable.  The top 3 listed in order of best combined destruction and injury rate are below.
1)Bombardier
2)Boeing
3)Airbus
